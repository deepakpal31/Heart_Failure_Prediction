 1. Boolean features
        * Sex - Gender of patient Male = 1, Female =0
        * Diabetes - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
        * Anaemia - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
        * High_blood_pressure - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
        * Smoking - 0 = No, 1 = Yes
        * DEATH_EVENT - 0 = No, 1 = Yes

2. Other informations
* mcg/L: micrograms per liter. mL: microliter. mEq/L: milliequivalents per litre
* The time feature seams to be highly correlated to the death event but there is no concret information of how this metric was measured patient by patient. Which makes it hard to use it in the analysis. But feel free to use it.
